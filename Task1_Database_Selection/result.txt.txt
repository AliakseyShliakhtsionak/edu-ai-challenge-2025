Database Recommendation for Scalable Social Platform
====================================================

Chain-of-Thought Reasoning
--------------------------

1. Requirement: Social platform with millions of users
   - Needs horizontal scalability and low-latency queries
   - Relational databases struggle at this scale
   - NoSQL systems preferred for scalability

2. Requirement: Store user profiles, posts, and user connections
   - User profiles: Structured and schema-flexible -> Document DB
   - Posts: Large and flexible -> Document DB
   - Connections (friendships/follows): Deeply relational -> Graph DB

3. Requirement: High read speed
   - 80% read workload
   - Read-optimized systems with indexing and caching perform well
   - Document and Graph DBs handle high read loads efficiently

4. Requirement: 80% reads / 20% writes
   - Favor read-optimized and eventually consistent systems
   - Replication and read replicas useful

5. Requirement: High scalability
   - Distributed architecture, replication, auto-sharding
   - NoSQL systems like MongoDB, Cassandra, Neo4j are ideal

Recommendation: Polyglot Persistence Approach
---------------------------------------------

| Data Type        | Recommended Database              |
|------------------|-----------------------------------|
| User Profiles     | Document DB (MongoDB, Couchbase) |
| Posts             | Document DB (MongoDB, DocumentDB)|
| Connections       | Graph DB (Neo4j, Amazon Neptune) |
| Hot Reads / Cache | In-memory DB (Redis)             |

Final Recommendation
---------------------

1. Primary Datastore:
   - MongoDB (Document DB) for profiles and posts:
     - Schema flexibility
     - High read performance
     - Horizontal scalability
     - Built-in replication and sharding

2. Secondary for Connections:
   - Neo4j or Amazon Neptune (Graph DB) for social graph:
     - Fast traversal
     - Supports complex queries for relationships

3. Caching Layer (Optional but Recommended):
   - Redis for hot data (feeds, profiles)

Bonus Tips
----------
- Use microservices to separate user, post, and graph services
- Maintain eventual consistency via messaging (e.g., Kafka)
