You are an expert AI system designer. I need your help choosing the best type of database for a new application.

Here are the project requirements:
- Itâ€™s a social platform with millions of users
- We need to store user profiles, posts, and user connections (friendships, follows, etc.)
- High read speed is required
- The workload will be 80% read operations and 20% write operations
- The system must be highly scalable as the user base grows

Please use Chain-of-Thought reasoning to analyze each of these requirements step-by-step. Then, based on that reasoning, justify and recommend the most suitable type of database (e.g., relational, document-based, graph, key-value, etc.).

Your reasoning should be logical, structured, and clearly show how you arrived at the final recommendation.
