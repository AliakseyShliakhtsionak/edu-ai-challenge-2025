404 Not Found Error When Accessing /customers/ClientId/{id} Endpoint Due to Missing API Registration in Azure API Management

Description
A 404 Not Found HTTP error is encountered when attempting to access the endpoint `https://someSite/customers/ClientId/12345`. This issue appears to be caused by the API not being registered or exposed within Azure API Management (APIM). As a result, requests to the endpoint are not properly routed, leading to failed API calls.

Steps to Reproduce
1. Open a browser or use an API client (e.g., Postman or curl).  
2. Send a GET request to `https://someSite/customers/ClientId/12345`.  
3. Observe the returned HTTP status code and response body.

Expected vs Actual Behavior
- Expected Behavior: The endpoint should return a valid HTTP 200 OK response with the customer data associated with `ClientId` 12345.  
- Actual Behavior: The endpoint returns an HTTP 404 Not Found error, indicating that the resource could not be located.

Environment
- API Gateway: Azure API Management (APIM)  
- Endpoint: `https://someSite/customers/ClientId/{id}`  
- Affected Service: Customer Data API  
- Method: GET  
- Client: Any (browser, Postman, etc.)

Severity or Impact
High â€“ This issue prevents clients from accessing critical customer information via the `/customers/ClientId/{id}` endpoint. It impacts integration functionality and could block downstream applications or services that depend on this API.
